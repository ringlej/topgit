Subject: [PATCH] Fix tg export --quilt --numbered w/ > 8 patches

Creating a quilt patch series with more than 8 patches with:
tg export --quilt --numbered patchdir

Causes the following error to be produced:
eval: 1: arithmetic expression: expecting EOF: "0008 + 1"

This is due to the leading 0 and the $(()) evaluates as octal rather than
decimal.

This patch removes the leading 0's when the $(()) evaluation is done.
